## Data Repository Service (DRS) API

The Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data in a single, standardized way regardless of where it’s stored or how it’s managed. The primary functionality of DRS is to map a logical ID to a means for physically retrieving the data represented by the ID.
